# Install Node.js LTS version for Linux using nvm with npm

# Create a folder for the project and navigate to that folder

# Init package.json

# Install express

# The folder should now consist of node_modules, package.json & package-lock.json

# Confirm that package.json has express as a dependencie, module as type and index.js as main

# Create a file index.js in the project folder with the the same content as in:
